                I played a key role in collaborative and leadership capabilities
                in web application development, using JavaScript, TypeScript,
                CSS, HTML and Angular as the primary framework. I skillfully
                implemented the latest versions of Angular, adhered to best
                practices, and incorporated rigorous testing protocols to ensure
                the highest quality applications. Through these frontend
                efforts, I delivered optimal and reliable solutions to end users
                through various web applications. Simultaneously, I demonstrated
                proficiency in the backend using Java and Spring Boot as a
                framework. Here, I designed and implemented services that
                allowed the acquisition, modification and updating of essential
                information. This dual experience in frontend and backend
                development has not only highlighted my versatility, but also
                contributed significantly to the overall success of the projects
                I have been involved in. in summary, I have the ability to lead
                the team and motivate it to follow the best practices taking
                advantage of the knowledge of all, I also have the ability to
                adapt to changes whether in technical terms such as changes in
                programming languages or the work area, it is also important for
                me good communication due to remote work, this allows us to be
                in sync to work better.
